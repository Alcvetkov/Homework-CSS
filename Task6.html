		<h2>CONTENT: notes on this 3col Fixed assignment</h2>
		<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectable where the div meets the .jpg background. I used the same 
		hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?
		</p>
		<p>The exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip. I get serious Float Drop when I resize(reduce) 
		the browser window. I think that is what "display: inline; /* stops IE doubling margin on float" is for, but 
		would like further explainention to understand this comment.
		</p>
		<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if there is also going to be separateversion wrappers 
		as we have here to contain the diffrent background images? Or perhaps this is an example of an inner div as the 
		book suggersts? I am still confused on that detail.
		</p>
		<p>Even though I have auto margin set on the wrapper div, the page still huggs the left side? I've tried it in 
		all of them, but it won't butch?
		</p>
		<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own...It's in the wrapper, but the "clear" seems to be allowing it 
		ouside. However, when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?</p>
